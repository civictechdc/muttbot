    "Keep several microfiber cloths underneath the front seat of your vehicle. Use them to dust off the dashboard, radio and steering wheel.",
    "Pet hair, dust, ashes from smoking can migrate into your computer and clog the open holes. Use the hose attachment of your vacuum to remove pet hair and dust from the back of your computer. Clean the monitor case with a slightly damp microfiber cloth. Be sure to also dust the power cords, floor and area around the computer, printer and fax machine too.",
    "Place a piece of silverware on the back of your neck for a quick cool down.",
    "Freeze several different sizes of water bottles to keep food chilled in an ice chest. When the water melts, you can drink it!",
    "Mustard, chocolate and lipstick can be removed by rubbing a few drops of liquid glycerin into the stains first and then rub in stain remover or laundry detergent. Launder as usual in cool water first.",
    "Use newspapers rather than paper towels, because they leave no lint and you are recycling!",
    "Put several drops of peppermint or cinnamon on cotton balls and place in a margarine container or small jar. Poke holes into the lid and put in an out-of-the-way area behind furniture or in a guest room or bathroom and your guests won’t have a clue.",
    "Data is embedded in the discs, so clean carefully by wiping with a soft cloth—from the center to the edge. Do not clean in a circular motion because that might damage the data.",
    "To untangle a delicate necklace, use a straight pin to gently pull out all of the knots. If that doesn't work, place the necklace on a hard, nonporous surface such as glass. Apply several drops of baby oil or mineral oil to the chain, then use the pin to untangle the links. Proper storage should help prevent tangling. Depending on the size of the necklace, you can drop it through a straw, wrap it around an empty spool of thread, or hang it on a nail attached to a bulletin board or other surface.",
    "Organization is the key in the laundry room, and it's easy to achieve by having several plastic bins or receptacles around — each with a specific purpose: one for lint, one with a sewing kit complete with prethreaded needles and buttons, one for lost-and-found items, one white hamper for white fabrics, and one colored hamper for bright or dark fabrics. In a cabinet or on a shelf, store all washing supplies in a large plastic basket. Place a hook on a wall or over a door for hangers. Clothes pulled from the dryer and hung immediately may not need ironing.",
    "Leather needs regular cleaning, because perspiration and body oils can get into the porous surface. For unfinished leather, dust with a soft cloth weekly; you can use a damp one on finished leather. Condition with a leather cleaner at least every six months (more often if it's a house favorite). For spots or spills, blot excess liquid as soon as you can and, for finished leather, use a small amount of water or soap. (On unfinished pieces, leave spot removal to the professionals.) Never use household cleaners or solvents, such as furniture polish, ammonia, or nail polish remover, which can damage leather.",
    "Most produce keeps best when it's stored in perforated plastic bags in the fridge. Put veggies and fruits in separate crisper drawers (ethylene gas emitted by fruits can cause greens to yellow). Try to use items within several days of purchase.",
    "To clean a keyboard, disconnect it and turn it upside down. Shake it gently to dislodge crumbs. Use the brush attachment of your vacuum cleaner to push out bits lurking beneath keys. Use a soft, clean makeup brush or paintbrush for additional dusting. Wipe keys with a slightly damp cloth. Lift dirt out of crevices using a cotton swab dampened with a few drops of rubbing alcohol. Let keyboard dry before reconnecting.",
    "Don't you dislike those little flying pests? Fruit flies thrive on or near rotting fruit or veggies stored in the open. When you buy produce, they may have already laid eggs on the items; the eggs hatch in the warmer environment of your home. The new flies then lay eggs in empty bottles and sink drains. If you let fruit ripen on the counter, eat it quickly. Or store produce in the fridge and set out just a few pieces at a time. Take garbage out daily to eliminate another breeding spot.",
    "Sweat won't stain if you let your antiperspirant or deodorant dry prior to putting on your clothes. Before you wash shirts, pretreat the underarm areas with undiluted liquid laundry detergent so sweat will rinse away. Pretreat any existing stains with household vinegar to help dissolve the perspiration. To prevent more buildup, wash in the hottest water that's safe for that fabric at least every third or fourth time.",
    "It's unsafe to reuse plastic water bottles. Once saliva, sweat, and bacteria get inside the bottle, there's no way to completely clean or sanitize it. Also, after extended use and rewashing, the plastic starts to break down. That's why commercial bottled water is stamped with a two-year (or less) expiration date. Although the water doesn't really 'expire,' it acquires an off taste.",
    "To remove candle wax from a carpet, first, wait for the wax to cool, then try to scrape off as much of the hardened drips as you can, using a dull knife. Then place a couple of white paper towels over the remaining wax and run a warm iron over the area. Repeat the process, using clean towels each time, until all the wax is gone. If wax residue remains, apply a bit of dry-cleaning solvent and blot.",
    "I hate the splatter when using my handheld electric mixer. Before mixing, I punch two holes in a paper plate and slide the beaters through. I attach it to the mixer, and it keeps the mess inside.",
    "I have lots of cottonwood trees, and the cotton gets stuck in the air-conditioner condenser unit. It can block airflow and cause the AC to stop cooling. I put mosquito netting around the unit, using clothespins. It’s easy to hose down when the cotton collects on the outside.",
    "I use a hair dryer daily, and had trouble with the cord getting tangled while using it. I placed a small ring hook on the wall about a foot from the outlet. I plug the hair dryer in and then run the cord through the hook. It keeps it from getting tangled. One little morning frustration gone.",
    "I have two adopted tomcats. They use the same litter box. When they do, they get litter all over the floor, making one big mess. I corrected the problem by getting a 19-gallon storage box. I cut a hole big enough for them to get in. Now when they use it and kick litter out, all of it will be in the box, which I dump back into the litter box.",
    "When buying plants, make sure there are no bugs and that the overall plant is healthy, with good coloring and undamaged leaves.",
    "Clean plant leaves often by dusting them or wiping with a damp cloth.",
    "I have lots of plastic grocery bags. A neighbor showed me how to fold them into small triangles. Straighten out the bag--especially the handles--fold in half with the handles at the top, then fold again in thirds. Starting at the bottom, fold up, forming a triangle. When you get to the handles, wrap around and tuck in the pocket. All my bags fit in a small container.",
    "DO NOT overwater! This can cause plant death! Put your finger into the soil about 1/4 to 1/2 inch. If it’s dry, the plant needs watering.",
    "I use a 1-tablespoon cookie scoop to fill mushrooms after I mix up my stuffing mixture. This results in perfectly mounded stuffed mushrooms every time! Yum!",
    "The roasting pan is not just for chicken anymore. I love cooking spaghetti in it, and it’s great for corn on the cob. It’s my new favorite pan to cook with. The shape of the pan just works better for many foods. I have a stainless-steel one, but I’m sure any type would work.",
    "When making stuffed peppers the other day, they kept falling over. I placed them in my fluted cake pan. Much easier to stuff, and they don’t fall over.",
    "Don't overstuff the washer because clothes won’t get clean!",
    "Wash whites (and lights) in one load and darks in another.",
    "Squeegee the walls after each shower, and you won't have much to clean!",
    "Scrub the toilet with a toilet brush a couple of times a week (takes only a minute!) to stop a hard-water build up.",
    "Newer toilets with a shiny finish are easier to keep clean.",
    "Use vinegar to clean and remove soap scum. Don't use vinegar on real marble.",
    "Baby wipes are great for quickly cleaning phones, sticky purse linings, and dirty hands.",
    "Try using a checkbook wallet as a coupon organizer.",
    "Use coffee cans as containers for small items in your garage or in children's rooms.",
    "Put down a coffee filter when chopping (not slicing) one tomato, onion, etc.",
    "Spread coffee grounds over flower beds containing acid-loving plants such as azaleas and rhododendrons.",
    "If you get extra mustard or soy sauce packets with a take-out meal, put them in the freezer. They make great mini ice packs for small boo-boos.",
    "Roll a section of the newspaper lengthwise, then cut across one end a few times and spread out the fringe. Use to brush away cobwebs or crumbs, then toss it out.",
    "Stuff packing peanuts into an old zippered pillow cover to create a soft bed for your dog or cat.",
    "Put a handful of packing peanuts into a potpourri jar and spritz with your favorite perfume to deodorize a room.",
    "Try cutting off the top of a plastic gallon milk jug just above the handle and using it as a scoop.",
    "To improve the crust of homemade bread, brush the top of the loaf with vinegar just before baking.",
    "Want your white sneakers to stay white? After purchasing new white canvas sneakers, spray them with spray starch to help them resist stains. The starch will repel grease and dirt, keeping them whiter!",
    "Going out in new shoes? Lots of fun. Slipping as you walk past your new crush? Not so much. Use sandpaper to distress slippery leather soles and slick surfaces won't slip you up.",
    "To remove the shell from a hard-boiled egg in one piece, exert gentle pressure while rolling it around the counter, then insert a teaspoon between the shell and the egg white and rotate it.",
    "If you love the look of lace, add some to your bedroom or guest room with this inexpensive trick. Buy a rectangular lace tablecloth that is 70-by-90 inches, and you can place it directly on top of your existing comforter. You'll have friends asking how you could afford to dress up your bed with lace!",
    "Have some beautiful clear jars, but don't know what to do with them? Try putting photos inside! Add marbles, rocks, colored sand, or other decoration at the bottom, then bend the photo ever-so-slightly so it fits in the curve of the jar.",
    "On sticky summer nights, cool down by sprinkling a little baby powder between your sheets before retiring for the night.",
    "Who knew your windows will appear larger--and will let a little more light into the room--if you just raise the curtain rod a few inches? You'll be surprised how much difference this makes.",
    "Here's the thing about drapes: They're expensive, and a cheaper option is usually available. If you can sew, simply buy a nice, heavy piece of fabric, hem the sides and bottom, and cut Xs instead of holes on top. Run ribbon through the Xs and hang on a rod! Another less-expensive option is a fabric shower curtain. The holes are already there, so just cut to size. Hem the bottom for a more finished look.",
    "Instead of throwing away lint you've cleaned out of your dryer's screen, use it as kindling for your fireplace. It lights quickly and can be stuffed places paper can't.",
    "Bananas to the rescue! A simple way to help bruises fade fast is with a banana peel. Just peel and apply a piece of banana peel, flesh side down, to the bruise, cover with a bandage, and leave on overnight. By the morning, the bruise will have faded."
